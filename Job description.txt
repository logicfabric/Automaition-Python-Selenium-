Summary
From Icicidirect broker account, I want to extract trade, order, portfolio info from 4 sub accounts. Another developer has already written some selenium and python code but it is not consistent.
Ideally, I would like to just launch one script and get all info.
Trade, Portfolio info is available to be downloaded as CSV file.
Order info needs to be extracted from the screen.

I have attached current code
